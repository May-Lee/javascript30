    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log(team, players);
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    console.log(team);
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] ='new one';
    console.log(team4);
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(team5);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    person.number = 99; //this assignment adds a key number with value 99 to original person object
    // how do we take a copy instead? we use Object.assign({}, objectName, { key1: value1, key2: alue2});
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12});
    console.log(cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
    // So if your object has another object nested inside it, after assigning, it will mean any changes to the 2nd layer will be also assigned to the reference
    //lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    // You can also parse it from JSON into a string, then back to JSON:

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    //now you could do dev2.social.twitter = '@coolman' <--in the example
    //basically, you stringify the object into JSON and then parse it immediately back into an object
